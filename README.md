# Trash Poker

## About
This is a development on the traditional 'recycling sorting' game that is used at educational workshops on solid waste management. Instead of attempting to simply sort waste, players are tasked with contaminating one anothers' waste streams: this requires both an understanding of what is and isn't recyclable, but also a degree of strategy. This game was developed for a workshop with the Zero Waste Pilot Programme at the MIT Media Lab, and is free for anyone to use. 


## Rules

This game is played in pairs. Each pair starts the game with their own 'recycling bin', containing 12 items (one of each item), dealt face up. Pairs are also dealt 3 instruction cards in their hand, face down.

In the middle of the space is a 'trash bin' where unwanted items are discarded. There are also special bins that appear during the course of play.

The goal of the game is have the most recyclable items in your recycling bin and any specialty bins (e.g. compost, clothing) you might also have, whilst avoiding contaminating these bins with items that shouldnâ€™t be there.

Play proceeds in turn. Each pair chooses a new instruction card for their hand, adds it to three that they
already have, and publicly plays one, following its instructions. At the end of their turn, the pair may place one item in the trash, or in a speciality bin (if owned), in addition to whatever items may have been played during the turn.

Play ends when the deck of instruction cards is depleted. For each correctly-placed item in the recycling bin, or in a speciality bin score +1 point. For each incorrect item, score -1 point. For reference, at the end of the game, the rule-sheet may be turned over: this has the correct labelling of items.

## Feedback
